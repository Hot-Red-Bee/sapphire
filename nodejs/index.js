//Nodejs was released in 2009 by Ryan Dahl. 
// It is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. 
// Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight 
// and efficient. It is perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run 
// across distributed devices. 
// Node.js is open-source and cross-platform, which means it can run on various operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.
